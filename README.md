# Pav-Bhaji

    Pav Bhaji – a spicy curry of mixed vegetables cooked in a special blend of spicesand served with soft buttered pav , is any Indian food
    lover’s dream.

    The boiled and mashed veggies give it a smooth yet chunky texture whilespecially blended Pav Bhaji Masala gives it an irresistible,mouthwatering aroma andtaste – serve it with a piece of buttery shallow fried bun and voila! – it’s a perfect partyfood that can be made in advance.
    
    It’s also the best way to make your kids eat someveggies as sometimes kids don’t like the taste of a particular veggie, but in pav bhaji
    they wouldn’t even notice any veggie and eat joyfully.
